EH2745: Computer Applications in Power Systems- Assignment 2. By Amritha Jayan and Yashwanth Damodaran

Objective: This code is part of Assignment 2, which aims to combines power grid modeling using PandaPower with machine learning techniques. The goal is to design a Python application that defines a power grid network, runs simulations to generate a dataset of measurements, and performs a machine learning experiment. It include implementing a k-means clustering algorithm to analyze the operating states of the grid, developing a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier for prediction, and reporting the results. The assignment focuses on bus voltage magnitudes and angles as the dataset.
